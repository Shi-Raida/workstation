## Standard Workflow

1. First think about the problem, read the code base to find the relevant files and write a plan in tasks/todo.md.
2. This plan should contain a list of actions to be carried out, which you can check off as you go along.
3. Before you start, contact me so that I can check the plan.
4. Then start working on the actions to be carried out, marking them as completed as you go along.
5. Please explain to me clearly the changes you have made at each stage.
6. Keep each task and code change as simple as possible. We want to avoid massive or complex changes. Each change should have minimal impact on the code. It's all about simplicity.
7. Finally, add a review section to the todo.md file with a summary of the changes made and any other relevant information.
