## 2025-08-25: Initial Product Planning

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Team

### Decision

Agent OS will be positioned as an Ansible-based workstation automation platform focused on Linux development environments, prioritizing comprehensive automation coverage over cross-platform compatibility in initial phases.

### Context

Analysis of existing codebase reveals a mature Ansible-based system with extensive Linux workstation automation capabilities. The system currently supports Ubuntu/Debian distributions with comprehensive package management, desktop environment configuration, and development tool setup.

### Rationale

- Leverages existing mature Ansible infrastructure and extensive task library
- Focuses resources on depth rather than breadth, ensuring robust Linux support
- Aligns with primary user base of Linux developers and DevOps professionals
- Provides clear foundation for future platform expansion

## 2025-08-25: Technology Stack Standardization

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

Maintain Ansible as core automation engine with Python 3 and Bash as primary scripting languages, using YAML for configuration and Jinja2 for templating.

### Context

Current tech stack provides proven reliability and extensive community support. Ansible's declarative approach aligns with infrastructure-as-code principles and provides excellent idempotency guarantees.

### Rationale

- Ansible provides mature ecosystem with extensive module library
- YAML configuration offers human-readable and version-controllable setup
- Jinja2 templating enables dynamic configuration generation
- Python and Bash provide necessary flexibility for custom automation tasks

## 2025-08-25: CI/CD Migration Strategy

**ID:** DEC-003
**Status:** Planning
**Category:** Infrastructure
**Stakeholders:** DevOps Lead, Development Team

### Decision

Migrate from GitLab CI to GitHub Actions while maintaining existing release automation and testing capabilities.

### Context

Current GitLab CI pipeline provides automated testing and semantic versioning. GitHub Actions migration aligns with broader ecosystem trends and improves integration with Agent-OS project structure.

### Rationale

- GitHub Actions provides native integration with GitHub-hosted repositories
- Simplifies dependency management and reduces external service dependencies
- Enables better integration with Agent-OS ecosystem and tooling
- Maintains existing automation capabilities while improving accessibility

## 2025-08-25: Desktop Environment Philosophy

**ID:** DEC-004
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, UX Lead

### Decision

Continue focusing on i3wm-based tiling window manager setup with productivity-focused tool selection rather than traditional desktop environments.

### Context

Current desktop configuration emphasizes keyboard-driven workflows with i3wm, alacritty terminal, rofi launcher, and polybar status bar. This setup appeals to developers and power users seeking efficient workflows.

### Rationale

- Tiling window managers significantly improve developer productivity
- Keyboard-driven interfaces reduce context switching and mouse dependency
- Lightweight configuration reduces system resource usage
- Appeals to target audience of developers and DevOps professionals
- Provides clear differentiation from traditional desktop automation tools
