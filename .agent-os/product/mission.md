## Pitch

Stable-Bot is a comprehensive automation framework designed to reproduce and synchronize workspace environments across multiple computers and servers. It eliminates the pain of manual environment setup and configuration drift by providing a declarative, version-controlled approach to workspace management.

## Users

**Primary User:** Personal use across several computers and servers for consistent development environment management.

**Secondary Users:** Developers and system administrators who need to:

- Maintain consistent environments across multiple machines
- Quickly reproduce workspace setups on new systems
- Synchronize configurations and dotfiles across devices
- Automate repetitive system administration tasks

## The Problem

Setting up and maintaining consistent development environments across multiple machines is time-consuming and error-prone. Developers face:

- Manual configuration of packages, applications, and settings on each new system
- Configuration drift between machines leading to "works on my machine" problems  
- Lost productivity when switching between computers or setting up new environments
- Difficulty backing up and restoring complete workspace configurations
- Inconsistent tooling and settings across personal and professional environments

## Differentiators

- **Ansible-based**: Leverages proven infrastructure automation technology for reliability
- **Personal-scale optimized**: Designed specifically for individual use across small fleets (3-7 machines)
- **Comprehensive coverage**: Handles everything from packages to dotfiles to application configurations
- **Template approach**: Provides a public template that others can fork and customize
- **Integration-ready**: Built for seamless integration with modern CI/CD and Agent-OS workflows

## Key Features

**Current Features:**

- Automated package management across different operating systems
- Dotfile synchronization and version control
- Application configuration management (mail clients, Firefox, i3 window manager, Zsh)
- Multi-environment support (personal computers + servers)
- Ansible playbook automation for consistent deployments

**Planned Features:**

- GitHub CI/CD pipeline integration for automated deployments
- Claude Code integration for AI-assisted configuration management  
- Agent-OS integration for enhanced automation capabilities
- Security improvements and credential management
- CLI UI for interactive installation and configuration
- Template customization tools for community adoption
